BSNL Telephone Database Management System 

Purpose :
The goal of our project is to develop a telephone database similar to what BSNL uses for maintaining it's client's databases.
Maintaining the clients data is the main task of any telephone database management system ; for maintaining the data we have used SQL Database storage system . 
In real world BSNL is utilising TCS as it's partner for carrying out these data management tasks .

"An innovative solution was delivered by Tata Consultancy Services 
(TCS) through its data center monitoring and remote tracking 
framework. The solution enabled integrated visibility of the data 
center, helping BSNL to maintain 99.9 percent system availability. "

" Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), a leading Indian 
communication service provider, has one of the largest and most 
complex data centers supporting fixed line and broadband 
businesses in the country. While performance and high availability 
are top priorities for the BSNL data center team, the challenge is to 
maintain high system availability and a real-time integrated view 
of the data center. "

Hence , we are preparing databases for three connections : 
 1. Landline
 2.Internet(Broadband)
 3. Mobile(Cellular)
Now these 3 connections are provided to a customer , that customer is given a permanent CId . 
This CId is an unique primary key which is utilised in all databases .
*Description of some other attributes*
Considering the case of Broadband connection , it is provided only in case of the customer owning a landline connection .
